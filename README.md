# Awesome Backlinks

If you've just launched a new project, your domain authority is probably very low. Your content is effectively invisible to Google.

This is a curated list of 60+ free and paid websites, where you can submit to get the first backlinks and increase domain authority.

If you want to sort the list by pricing and DA, check out the list on our [website](https://refined.so/tools/seo-directories).
